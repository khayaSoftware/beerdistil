The following project can be run using a web stack such as xampp. Please set up the configuration files to point to this directory on your local machine.

For this project I chose to use php purely, because I wanted to show my skills in the use of PHP, even though I have professional experience using javascript and some of its frameworks, such as JQuery, and Angular. I realise that front end languages couldve made some features of this website much quicker.

I have also added unit tests using phpunit, and composer. To run this test please ensure that phpunit is installed on your machine.

I also chose to not use frameworks because I wanted to avoid the hassle of the setting up this project on some one else's machine. Even though I have experience writing php using frameworks, such as zend and wordpress.

Lastly not to make excuses but I was constricted on time as I had a lot of errands to run at this time of year. I would love to explain what I feel I could done better.
